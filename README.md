# ü©∫ PleuroAI Assistant - AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support Tool

This project is developed for the Microsoft Azure Hackathon 2025. The **PleuroAI Assistant** is a clinical support tool designed to assist in diagnosing **Tuberculous Pleural Effusion (TPE) or Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPE)** using machine learning, with guidance provided by GPT-based suggestions.

## üîç Project Overview

The assistant receives a patient's diagnostic input, predicts the likelihood of TPE/MPE, and recommends the next clinical steps using GPT (OpenAI) integration.

## üöÄ Future Development

We plan to:
- Extend the model for **multi-class classification** to include other pleural diseases
- Enhance GPT prompts for **differential diagnosis**
  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì for machine learning model
- **Flask** ‚Äì for serving API
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì for interactive UI
- **Azure OpenAI** ‚Äì GPT model for clinical advice
- **Azure Cosmos DB** ‚Äì to store input, prediction, and advice
- **GitHub** ‚Äì source code repository

## üß† AI Model

- Trained using cleaned dataset of 133 samples.
- Uses patient features such as:
  - Age, Gender
  - Ultrasound findings (ECHO, DIAPHRAGM, FIBRIN, THICKENING)
  - Pleural Fluid Tests (PROTEIN, LDH, GLUCOSE, ADA)
- Output: Prediction (Likely TPE / Not TPE)
